They are either scrolling, tapping, watching, or playing, digital content on a piece of glass. This time is spent with no avail of life progress or succession. Sometimes too distracted to even look up when somebody is talking, or when walking on the street, or even when driving. Phones, such an important revolutionary tool, have become a part of society's downfall."

Three hours, is a quarter of your waking time, spent scrolling. That's a lot of time. And that's just the average. Some people spend up to 10 hours a day on their phone. That's almost half of their day."
